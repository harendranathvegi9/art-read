                    <p>Views like these were typical of the critical reception of Edouard Manet's <span class="figc f1" data-id="f1"><em>Le Dejeuner sur I'herbe</em></span> <span class="fig f1" data-id="f1">[Fig. 1]</span> when it was first exhibited (as <em>Le Bain</em>) at the Salon des Refuses in 1863. And ever since, the painting has continued to haunt and baffle its commentators, so that an expansive literature has accumulated as to its possible meanings or to the meanings of its possible lack of meaning.</p>
                    <p>
                    It is possible that the painting, as Pelloquet stated, "will never be understood", and that its enigma is part of its intended nature. To be sure, such slightly earlier paintings as Manet's <span class="figc f10" data-id="f10"><em>Le Vieux Musicien</em></span> <span class="fig f10" data-id="f10">[Fig. 10]</span>, <span class="figc f9" data-id="f9"><em>La Peche</em></span> <span class="fig f9" data-id="f9">[Fig. 9]</span>, and even the seemingly forthright <span class="figc f24" data-id="f24"><em>Nymphe Surprise</em></span> <span class="fig f24" data-id="f24">[Fig. 24]</span> are all "strange" in one way or another, as is, of course, <span class="figc f20" data-id="f20"><em>Olympia</em></span> <span class="fig f20" data-id="f20">[Fig. 20]</span>, painted roughly at the same time or slightly after <span class="figc f1" data-id="f1"><em>Le Dejeuner sur I'herbe</em></span>. I needn't go into the oddities of these works here, but merely mention them to signal that Manet seems, almost from the outset, to have clothed or veiled the meanings of his compositions in a way that no other artist of the time is known to have done; enigma was part of his game, it seems, in these early break-through years. Possibly, the enigmatic structures of these paintings and of others as regards their meaning or intelligibility were motivated by a wish to engage their viewers more prolongedly in what was there to be seen and thought about-in any case, this has certainly been their effect.

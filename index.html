                    <p>"It is a rebus of exaggerated dimensions, and it will never be understood"; "I search in vain for the meaning of this hardly decent riddle", and "I cannot imagine what can have made an intelligent and distinguished artist choose so absurd a composition".<sup class="ref r1" data-id="r1">[1]</sup></p>
                    <p>Views like these were typical of the critical reception of Edouard Manet's <em>Le Dejeuner sur I'herbe</em> <span class="fig f1" data-id="f1">[Fig. 1]</span> when it was first exhibited (as <em>Le Bain</em>) at the Salon des Refuses in 1863. And ever since, the painting has continued to haunt and baffle its commentators, so that an expansive literature has accumulated as to its possible meanings or to the meanings of its possible lack of meaning.</p>
                    <p>It is possible that the painting, as Pelloquet stated, "will never be understood", and that its enigma is part of its intended nature. To be sure, such slightly earlier paintings as Manet's <em>Le Vieux Musicien</em> <span class="fig f10" data-id="f10">[Fig. 10]</span>, <em>La Peche</em> <span class="fig f9" data-id="f9">[Fig. 9]</span>, and even the seemingly forthright <em>Nymphe Surprise</em> <span class="fig f24" data-id="f24">[Fig. 24]</span> are all "strange" in one way or another, as is, of course, <em>Olympia</em> <span class="fig f20" data-id="f20">[Fig. 20]</span>, painted roughly at the same time or slightly after <em>Le Dejeuner sur I'herbe</em>. I needn't go into the oddities of these works here, but merely mention them to signal that Manet seems, almost from the outset, to have clothed or veiled the meanings of his compositions in a way that no other artist of the time is known to have done; enigma was part of his game, it seems, in these early break-through years. Possibly, the enigmatic structures of these paintings and of others as regards their meaning or intelligibility were motivated by a wish to engage their viewers more prolongedly in what was there to be seen and thought about-in any case, this has certainly been their effect.</p>
                    <p>What most baffled contemporary commentators about <em>Le Dejeuner sur l'herbe</em> was, as it is well known, the "absurdity" as in Thoré's remark, of the nude in the company of dressed males in an outdoor setting, a highly improper event even if, in the real mof painting, Titian's (then believed to be Giorgione's) <em>Concert Champêtre</em> in the Louvre, was soon recognized to be an important source and precedent for this.</p>
                    <p>But there were other "absurdities" in Manet's painting, and, among these, one which I believe should be taken more seriously than before. Thus, in his review of <em>Le Dejeuner sur l'herbe</em> at the Salon des Refusés, Thoré made the significant remark that the man to the right, the pointing man, "didn't even have the idea of removing, while out of doors, his horrible padded hat".<sup class="ref r2" data-id="r2">[2]</sup> This has been quoted often before, but commentators have not so far stopped to think further about the implications of this remark. Obviously, however, Thoré here, as a man of his time, pointed to the fact that a hat like that was not used in open air, but was of a type designed for use at home or at any rate indoors as, in fact, we see in many contemporaneous portraits such as Alphonse Legros' <em>Portrait of the Artist's Father</em>, 1856, or in Manet's own <em>Portrait of the Artist's Parents</em>, 1860, and in his <em>Self-Portrait with a Scull-Cap</em>, 1878-79 <span class="fig f2" data-id="f2">[Fig. 2]</span>.<sup class="ref r3" data-id="r3">[3]</sup> There can be no doubt that Manet, belonging to the bourgeousie as he did, was aware of this, and we need only look to Henri Fantin-Latour's <em>Portrait of Edouard Manet</em>, 1867 <span class="fig f3" data-id="f3">[Fig. 3]</span>, in order to see that Manet was highly conscious of decorum&#8212;e.g., of which kind of hat to wear in public, as he is seen here, ready for the street, or anywhere out doors...<p>

Bürger</em>:"Je ne devine pas ce qui a pu faire choisir à un artiste intelligent et distingué une composition si absurde [...]"; Thoré quoted from Michael Fried, <em>Manet's Modernism or, The Face of Painting in the 1860s</em>, Chicago and London,1996, pp. 297 and 570, n. 83. For Pelloquet's and Etienne's statements see Fried, <em>ibidem</em>, p. 560, n. 20, and p. 570, n. 82, respectively. My translation of Pelloquet's statement differs slightly from Fried's. For many other similarexamples of contemporary criticism of Manet's picture, see Éric Darragon, <em>Manet</em>, Paris, 1991, especially pp.115-129.

While it is true that a tasselled cap called a faluche is worn by many French students, and is often decorated with various symbolic emblems, signifying the owner's line of study, personal interests and so on, the tradition of this <em>faluche</em> was instigated only in June 1888 (and celebrated annually ever since), according to numerous web pages on the internet (searchword: faluche)</p>
